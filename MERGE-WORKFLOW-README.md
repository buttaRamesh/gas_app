## üö® Handling Merge Conflicts

If you encounter merge conflicts, the advanced script will:

1. **Detect the conflict** and show conflicted files
2. **Give you options:**
   - Abort the merge (safe)
   - Continue to resolve manually

### Manual Resolution Steps:
```cmd
# 1. Open conflicted files in your editor
# Look for these markers:
<<<<<<< HEAD
your changes
=======
Claude's changes
>>>>>>> claude/swf-011CUXJPdZbEdDyjL5FcyUBX

# 2. Edit the file to keep the changes you want
# Remove the conflict markers

# 3. Stage the resolved files
git add <filename>

# 4. Complete the merge
git commit

# 5. Push to remote
git push origin main
```

## üìã Branch Names

Current configuration:
- **Claude Branch:** `claude/swf-011CUXJPdZbEdDyjL5FcyUBX`
- **Main Branch:** `main`
- **Remote:** `origin`

If branch names change in the future, edit the scripts and update these variables:
```batch
set CLAUDE_BRANCH=claude/swf-011CUXJPdZbEdDyjL5FcyUBX
set MAIN_BRANCH=main
set REMOTE=origin
```

3. ‚úÖ Backend and frontend tests pass (if applicable)
4. ‚úÖ You have network connection
5. ‚úÖ You're ready to update main branch

## üêõ Common Issues

### Issue: "Not a git repository"
**Solution:** Run the script from the `gas_app` directory

### Issue: "Failed to fetch from remote"
**Solution:** Check your internet connection and GitHub access

### Issue: "Branch does not exist"
**Solution:** Claude hasn't pushed yet, or branch name is different

### Issue: "Merge conflict detected"
**Solution:**
1. Use advanced script for guidance
2. Resolve conflicts manually
3. Or abort and ask Claude to resolve

### Issue: "Permission denied (push)"
**Solution:** Check your GitHub credentials and repository access

## üìû Need Help?

If something goes wrong:
1. Run `check-status.bat` to see current state
2. Don't panic - Git can undo most things
3. If unsure, don't run `rollback-merge.bat`
4. Ask Claude Code for help!

## üîí Safety Features

All scripts include:
- ‚úÖ Error detection at each step

## üí° Tips

1. **Always check status first** - Run `check-status.bat` before merging
2. **Use advanced for important merges** - Extra safety is worth it
3. **Keep backups** - Push your work before merging
4. **Read the output** - Scripts tell you what's happening
5. **Don't force push main** - Unless you really know what you're doing
